HeartChart graphs your conversations with friends and loved ones, through the lens of heart emoji frequency, or any other repeated text you might be interested in. 

By displaying heart emoji usage over time, HeartChart can help remind you of the good times, or point out who might be needing a little extra love in your life. Using SMS and iMessage data available in iPhone backups, HeartChart creates matplotlib graph of textual frequency counted by usage during each week of contact with that person, divided between the texts sent and received. By marking who sent what, you can examine how your messaging habits influence your friend, and vice versa.

To use this script, create an unencrypted backup of your iphone, and then search for and copy the ‘3d0d7e5fb2ce288813306e4d4636395e047a3d28’ file to a separate folder which also containins heartchart.py. The file you just copied is a SQLite database of all your iMessages and SMS texts. Rename it ‘texts’.
